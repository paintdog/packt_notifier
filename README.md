This tool scrapes [the Packt website](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning) and informs you by email about new free learning ebooks (e. g. "Go Design Patterns"). If you allready have this book in your booklist, you will be informed otherwise you will be pleased to download the new ebook.

It is not a complete automated solution, but it works for me.
